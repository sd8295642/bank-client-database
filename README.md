# Amityville Bank Client Database

## Description

Amityville Bank Client Database was designed to create an efficient, secure, and user-friendly system for managing client information in a banking environment. The primary motivation behind this project was to address the challenges faced by banks in handling large volumes of client data while ensuring data integrity. By developing this database, we aimed to streamline the process of storing, retrieving, and updating client information.
This project was built upon the basis of creating a client database that is easily traversable and clear to read.
Throughout the development of the Amityville Bank Client Database, we gained valuable insights into database design and management, as well as how to properly secure user data.
